- 3265 datapoints in total
- 2500 : 765 train â€“ validation split

## Models

### Preliminary Analysis
1. Naive forecase
2. Moving average
3. Removing trends and seasonality followed by moving average

### Neural Network based analysis
1. Single layer (linear regression)
2. Multi layer
3. RNN layers
